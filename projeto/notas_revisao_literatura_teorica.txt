######Exposição do modelo Ho e Saunders em Maudos e Guevara (2003)
    "In this models, a bank is viewed as a risk-averse dealer in the credit market, 2 acting as an intermediary between demanders and suppliers of funds" p. 3

    "The planning horizon is a single period, before any deposits or loans are made, remain constant for the whole, remaining constant for the whole period." p. 3

    "The banks, who are risk averse and have to deal with demands for loans, and
    offers of deposits, that reach them asymmetrically in time, must set interest rates on
    loans (rL) and deposits (rD) optimally so as to minimise the risk deriving from the
    uncertainty of interest rates in the money markets to which they have to resort in
    the event of excessive demand for loans or insufficient supply of deposits. For this,
    they set their interest rates as a margin relative to the interest rate of the money market (r), i.e.,

r_D=r-a
r_L=r+b

s = r_L - r_D = a + b

######Determinates em ibid.

    a. The competitive structure of the markets. This depends on the elasticity of the
    demand for loans and the supply of deposits (b), such that the less elastic the demand
    for credit (or supply of deposits), the less will be the value of b, and the bank will be
    able to apply high margins if it exercises monopoly power. Consequently, the ratio
    a=b proxies the possible monopoly profits implicit in bank margins.

    b. Average operating costs. The extension of the model realized in this paper
    yield the inclusion of an additional term, the average operating costs, in the explanatory equation of the interest margin. Consequently, firms that incur high unit costs
    will logically need to work with higher margins to enable them to cover their higher
    operating costs. Observe that, even in the absence of market power and of any kind
    of risk, a positive margin will be necessary in order to cover operating costs.

    c. Risk aversion, expressed by the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, U00ðW Þ=
    U0
    ðW Þ, where on the assumption that the bank is risk averse, U00ðW Þ < 0, the former
    expression is greater than zero. Obviously, the more risk-averse banks will charge
    higher margins. 7

    d. The volatility of money market interest rates. The more volatile they are,
    the greater will be the market risk, and it will therefore be necessary to operate with
    higher margins, as the banks will require a higher premium at the margin.

    e. The credit risk, captured by the variable r2
    L. The greater the uncertainty or the
    volatility of the return expected on the loans granted (risk of default), the greater will
    be the margin with which the bank works.
